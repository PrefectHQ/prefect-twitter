-Then, register to [view the block](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/ui/blocks/) on Prefect Cloud:
+Requires an installation of Python 3.7+.
 
-```bash

+These tasks are designed to work with Prefect 2.0. For more information about how to use Prefect, please refer to the [Prefect documentation](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/).

+<!--- ### Saving credentials to block
 
 Note, to use the `load` method on Blocks, you must already have a block document [saved through code](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/concepts/blocks/#saving-blocks) or [saved through the UI](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/ui/blocks/).
 
-### Write and run a flow
+Below is a walkthrough on saving block documents through code.
 
-```python
-from prefect import flow
-from prefect_twitter.tasks import (
-    goodbye_prefect_twitter,
-    hello_prefect_twitter,
-)
+1. Head over to <SERVICE_URL>.
+2. Login to your <SERVICE> account.
+3. Click "+ Create new secret key".
+4. Copy the generated API key.
+5. Create a short script, replacing the placeholders (or do so in the UI).
 
+```python
+from prefect_twitter import Block
+Block(api_key="API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER").save("BLOCK_NAME_PLACEHOLDER")
+```
 
-@flow
-def example_flow():
-    hello_prefect_twitter
-    goodbye_prefect_twitter
+Congrats! You can now easily load the saved block, which holds your credentials:
 
-example_flow()
+```python
+from prefect_twitter import Block
+Block.load("BLOCK_NAME_PLACEHOLDER")
 ```
